It was tennis ball-ey, got stuck on the surface, the cutters were really effective, little bit variable I think - as opposed to the last pitch we were on. So I guess trying to make those sort of adjustments on the same sort of grounds is important, and Sri Lanka were also really good at the top. And then Glenn Phillips and Daryll Mitchell put together a partnership, and it was an incredible knock to get a very very good total on this surface. [On Phillips?] Any hundred is amazing and you see it all the time on good surfaces, and here you see a guy trying to have to work really, really hard to get his team out of  trouble. And then to try and move that pressure on to the opposition, and he just did it incredibly well.""</p><p>SL skipper <b>Dasun Shanaka</b>: ""I think we started really well, particularly in the first 10 overs. But credit to Glenn Phillips who played an outstanding knock. We also dropped a few catches. 160 is always a tough ask with their bowling attack, but also Boult and Southee bowled really well up front. [losing so many wickets in the powerplay?] There's a way to chase big totals, and in the first couple of tables you have to give yourself a chance. We never got settled in the wicket. [approach the next two games] If we get a couple of wins, we're still in with a chance of qualifying, so just looking forward to that.""</p><p>JOYDEEPSINGHGIL: ""I'm sure if sl didn't drop Phillips catch nz score would've below 135 and sl would've chased that amount of runs could've rain biter match than completely one sided today wasn't sl day they misfielded missed run out chances too and dropped the crucial catch of Phillips which eventually costed them this match.""

Ha! You're not wrong Rohit. Lucky you I guess.</p><p><b>Glenn Phillips</b> is the <b>Player of the Match</b> for his 64-ball 104: ""[discussions at 3 for 15] Me and Daryll were really clear we wanted to be as positive as possible, and try and make the right positive choice. On a pitch like that it was a little difficult to hit the slower ball, so it was just about getting through and trying to get to a competitive total. At the end of the day I think we were a little bit above par. [how much did you enjoy your innings] I try to entertain as much possible, and today it worked out well. But the way the bowlers bowl and the catches that were taken, it was incredible from the team as well. [what does it mean to score a century in a WC?] It's absolutely indescribable, but for it's just about sticking to my process.""</p><p><b>10.25pm</b> Well, that's that and what started as quite a harrowing test of New Zealand's credentials has ended in a romp. Following on from Glenn Phillips' masterful century to help put up a competitive 167, Tim Southee and Trent Boult broke the back of the Lankan chase to reduce Sri Lanka to 8 for 4 inside the powerplay. There was the faintest of hopeful glimmers when Dasun Shanaka and Bhanuka Rajapaksa were at the crease, but the ask by that point seemed always beyond them. In the end the chase just petered out, as NZ recorded their second straight comprehensive win of the tournament. They're well on their way to the semis, barring something calamitous, while Sri Lanka now need to win their remaining two games and hope other results go their way.</p>"

The Zimbabwean squad does a mini-lap of honor high-fiving the healthy contingent of fans who have come out to support them.</p><p><b>Player of the Match is Sikandar Raza: </b> ""I think I'm lost for words. My throat's dry, probably because of all the emotions. I can't tell you how proud I am of this bunch of boys. The way our seamers started at the top as well is just unbelievable and the way we backed it up in the field and the way we kept believing, I don't think there's any words I can share right now. [On wrist tapping signal to Craig Ervine] When we were coming to Australia, I said to my captain, 'If you become Man of the Match, pick any watch from the catalogue and I'll buy you. But if I win Man of the Match, then you're gonna buy me one. So I'm just reminding him that you now owe me three watches now actually. One more thing I thought. There was a small clip sent to me this morning of Ricky Ponting having a small word. I was excited, I was nervous, I was thrilled about today. The motivation was always there but if I needed a little push, I thought that clip did a wonder so thanks very much to Ricky as well.""</p><p>So Raza takes 3 wickets and also is center stage with the final ball runout relay to secure a famous Zimbabwe win, very deserved winner of the Player of the Match award.</p><p><b>Pakistan captain Babar Azam:</b> ""Very disappointing performance in my team. We were not up to the mark in the batting. We had a bad first six overs, but Shadab and Shan built a partnership but unfortunately Shadab out and then back to back wickets and pressure built on the batting. First six overs we are not using the new ball good. Later on we finished well. We'll sit together and learn from our mistakes and come back hard next match.""</p><p><b>Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine:</b> ""It's so special. Especially for the work that we did to get into the Super 12s and we didn't want our tournament to end there. We wanted to come in and play some really good cricket against some top teams and I thought we did that exceptionally well today. I thought after our batting performance, we thought that we were maybe 20 or 25 short. But our seamers hit their straps early on and there was just a little bit more in the wicket compared to when we started off. Raza came to the party as he always does and picked up a few crucial wickets in the middle there. [On the promise about the watches to Raza] I think he's got three Man of the Matches so I'm gonna be broke by the time we get home. I just want to say thanks to the Zim support that came out today to support us. You guys really lift our spirits wherever we go so a special thanks.""</p><p>Well, Pakistan's semi-final hopes are now hanging on by a thread. Zimbabwe meanwhile are suddenly in a promising position with three points from two matches and three left to play against Netherlands, Bangladesh and India.
